The values of Maiar and Hobbit are Sauron and Frodo respectively.  They don't show The Necromancer or Bilbo.  I believe they are written over from the later statements but are still added to length.

The capacity of the hash table after I have hashed all the items is 8.
I feel like it should be more because it shows I have undefined key value pairs.

For the exercise WhatDoesThisDo,
    it should console.log the values 20 and 10 respectively if it's the same case from the code I have written.

Demonstrate understanding of Hash maps:

First Hashmap:

[22, 88, , , 4, 15, 28, 17, 59, 31, 10, ]

Second Hashmap:

[ 10, [28, 19], 20, 12, , 5, [15, 33], , , 17]
