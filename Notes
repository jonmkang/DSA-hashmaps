The values of Maiar and Hobbit are Sauron and Frodo respectively.  They don't show The Necromancer or Bilbo.  I believe they are written over from the later statements but are still added to length.

The capacity of the hash table after I have hashed all the items is 8.
I feel like it should be more because it shows I have undefined key value pairs.
